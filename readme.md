# Ansible library demo

A small demonstration to show how you make a simple Ansible Module.

Bas Magr√© <bas.magre@babelvis.nl>

## Storyline

We have a simple api that can get, set, change and delete a key-value pair. The key must be a letter and the value a number. The api needs authentication with username and password or a token. See `Run demo api` for the complite definition.
In ansible we need to build a module that can set/get a charachter with a number and clear all charachters. This is what we need in the playbooks.

So we need:

- the arguments charachter and number (key and value)
- 3 actions in the module: set, get and clear
- authentication with username/password OR the use of a token
- an endpoint where the API can be accessed.

## Run demo api

There is a demo api in the folder `api-dotnet-src` we only need the run the docker container. But the source code is here if you want to see it.

```bash
cd api-dotnet-src
# build the docker image (already done)
# docker build . -t opvolger/demo-api-ansible
# push the docker image to docker hub (already done, only I can do this)
# docker push opvolger/demo-api-ansible
# run the docker container (you only need to do this)
docker run -p 5041:8080  opvolger/demo-api-ansible
```

Now you can visit the swagger interface of the demo api: [http://localhost:5041/swagger](http://localhost:5041/swagger)

## Developer Setup

Normally I do use a virtual environment, but since I only use standard modules/application that are already installed on my machine, I skip this now

There are 2 ansible modules `api_demo_start.py` and `api_demo.py`. The `api_demo_start.py` is a first setup with only the arguments and description of the module. The `api_demo.py` has the full interaction with the docker container.

### Python virtual environment

If you want to use python environments, you can do it

```bash
# setup of the virtual environment (only onetime)
python -m venv venv
# use the venv
source venv/bin/activate
# install required python libs (only onetime)
pip install ansible-core requests
```

### Debug modules

In vscode create file `.vscode/launch.json`

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python Debugger: api_demo.py with Arguments",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/ansible-playbook/library/api_demo.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/tests/arguments.json"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Python Debugger: api_demo_start.py with Arguments",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/ansible-playbook/library/api_demo_start.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "args": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/tests/arguments.json"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

and create `tests/arguments.json`

```json
{
    "ANSIBLE_MODULE_ARGS": {
        "endpoint": "https://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/",
        "character": "B",
        "number": 4,
        "action": "set"
    }
}
```

### Generate/Test Docs

```bash
# test doc generation
cd ansible-playbook
ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=./library ansible-doc -t module api_demo
```

## Run the module

```bash
cd ansible-playbook
# with ansible
ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=./library ansible -m api_demo -a 'endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:5041/ token=secret action=clear' localhost
# with ansible-playbook
ansible-playbook playbook-demo-start.yaml -vvv
ansible-playbook playbook-demo.yaml -vvv
```
